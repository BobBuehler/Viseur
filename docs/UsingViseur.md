# Using Viseur

The initial boiler-plating for a game using this framework is created using [the Cadre framework](https://github.com/siggame/Cadre), utilizing Creer commands.

The basic steps for implementing a piece of the game are as follows:
* Add sprite assets to the game's resources
* Initialize an object from the game or object's initial state
* Change an object's status depending on the object's state at a particular game time

Following the above steps will allow you to implement basic functionality within the game. There are additional techniques thaat can be used to add additional features and functionality to the game, as below:
* Add additional Game layars
* Add user accessible settings

This list is not fully comprehensive, and more can and will be added as helpful tips and tricks are created and discovered; suggestions can be submitted via a [github issue](https://github.com/siggame/Viseur/issues)
