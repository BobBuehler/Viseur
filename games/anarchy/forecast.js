 * @typedef {Object} ForecastState - A state representing a Forecast

 * @property {string} direction - The direction the wind will blow fires in. Can be 'north', 'east', 'south', or 'west'.
 * @property {string} gameObjectName - String representing the top level Class that this game object is an instance of. Used for reflection to create new instances on clients, but exposed for convenience should AIs want this data.
 * @property {string} id - A unique id for each instance of a GameObject or a sub class. Used for client and server communication. Should never change value after being set.
 * @property {number} intensity - How much of a Building's fire that can be blown in the direction of this Forecast. Fire is duplicated (copied), not moved (transfered).
 * @property {Array.<string>} logs - Any strings logged will be stored here. Intended for debugging.
